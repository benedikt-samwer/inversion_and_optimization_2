    "\n",
    "The **advection-diffusion equation** is a fundamental equation in transport phenomena, describing how a scalar quantity, such as temperature or concentration of a substance, evolves under the combined effects of advection and diffusion. It plays a critical role in various scientific and engineering applications, including fluid dynamics, environmental modelling, and biomedical imaging.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In many practical scenarios, obtaining analytical solutions to the advection-diffusion equation is challenging due to complex boundary conditions and variable coefficients. Therefore, numerical methods such as the **finite difference method** are essential for solving this equation efficiently. The steady-state form of the advection-diffusion equation in two spatial dimensions is given by:\n",

    "The steady-state advection-diffusion equation can be discretised using numerical methods such as the **finite difference method (FDM)**, which approximates derivatives using local grid points. By applying a five-point stencil and an upwind finite-difference discretisation, the equation can be rewritten in the form of a **linear system**:\n",
